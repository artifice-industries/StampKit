# StampKit
Communicate with [Stamp](https://stamp.xyz) from remote devices.

## Overview
The StampKit package provides the classes needed for your apps to communicate with Stamp.

**NOTE:** This package and the underlying [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc) API is under active development and may change at any time...

## Installation

#### Xcode 11+
[Add the package dependency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) to your Xcode project using the following repository URL: 
``` 
https://github.com/artifice-industries/StampKit
```
#### Swift Package Manager

Add the package dependency to your Package.swift and depend on "StampKit" in the necessary targets:

```  swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/artifice-industries/StampKit", .branch("master"))
]
```

## Usage

Import into your project files using Swift:

``` swift
import StampKit
```

### First Steps

Obtain a `SKTimeline` to use in your app.

#### Automatic

Using `SKBrowser` and providing it a delegate that implements the `SKBrowserDelegate` protocol, instances of Stamp servers can be automatically discovered. The browser has a `servers` property that is a set of `SKServerFacade` objects. Each `SKServerFacade` has a `timelines` property that holds a set of `SKTimeline` objects discovered on the network.

Create the `SKBrowser`:

``` swift
let browser = SKBrowser()
browser.delegate = self
browser.start()

// Optionally refresh the discovered servers repeatedly after any number of seconds.
browser.refresh(every: 3)
```

Conform to the `SKBrowserDelegate` protocol:

``` swift
func browser(_: SKBrowser, didUpdateTimelinesForServer server: SKServerFacade) {
    print(server.timelines)
}

func browser(_: SKBrowser, didUpdateServers servers: Set<SKServerFacade>) {
    print(servers)
}
```

#### Manually 

If you don't want to automatically discover Stamp or in the likely instances that mDNS (bonjour) packets are dropped by managed switches, you can also do it manually by first creating a `SKServerFacade`:

``` swift
let hostIPAddress = "10.101.1.1"
let receivePortNumber = StampKitPortNumber // 24601
let server = SKServerFacade(host: hostIPAddress, port: receivePortNumber)

server.refreshTimelines(withCompletionHandler: { timelines in
    // Do something with the returned timelines...
    timelines.forEach( { print($0.description) })
})
```
